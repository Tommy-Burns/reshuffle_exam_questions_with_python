The questions.txt file is the sample question that was used and defines the structure for all use cases.
Modifications can be made to the regular expression on line 42 of reshuffle.py to accommodate different ways of numbering questions.

The script automatically shuffles the options because shuffle_options is True by default. If it is changed to False, there will be no shuffling.
However, in other to shuffle the questions also, shuffle_questions must be set to True (It is False by default).
